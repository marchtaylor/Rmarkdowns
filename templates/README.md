# Templates

Some basic R Markdown templates of interest:

1.  **supplMat.Rmd** - Creates either a pdf or Word document. Automatically numbers figures and tables with "*S*" prefix. Shows how to load pre-existing figures and tables to ensure sizing in .doc.
2.  **kableExtra_tables.Rmd** - Better looking tables for pdf and html. More examples in vignettes on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=kableExtra).
3.  **dynamicChunks.Rmd** - Uses code chunks to create dynamic markdown instructions, such as headers, text, plots. Helpful when looping over several outputs to prevent repetitive chunks.
