	abstract = {The Northern Humboldt Current Ecosystem is one of the most productive in the world in terms of fish production. Its location near to the equator permits strong upwelling under relatively low winds, thus creating optimal conditions for the development of plankton communities. These communities ultimately support abundant populations of grazing fish such as the Peruvian anchoveta, Engraulis ringens. The ecosystem is also subject to strong inter-annual environmental variability associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which has major effects on nutrient structure, primary production, and higher trophic levels. Here our objective is to model the contributions of several external drivers (i.e. reconstructed phytoplankton changes, fish immigration, and fishing rate) and internal control mechanisms (i.e. predator-prey) to ecosystem dynamics over an ENSO cycle. Steady-state models and time-series data from the Instituto del Mar del Peru (IMARPE) from 1995 to 2004 provide the base data for simulations conducted with the program Ecopath with Ecosim. In simulations all three external drivers contribute to ecosystem dynamics. Changes in phytoplankton quantity and composition (i.e. contribution of diatoms and dino- and silicoflagellates), as affected by upwelling intensity, were important in dynamics of the El Nino of 1997-98 and the subsequent 3 years. The expansion and immigration of mesopelagic fish populations during El Nino was important for dynamics in following years. Fishing rate changes were the most important of the three external drivers tested, helping to explain observed dynamics throughout the modeled period, and particularly during the post-El Nino period. Internal control settings show a mix of predator-prey control settings: however a "wasp-waist" control of the ecosystem by small pelagic fish is not supported. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The determination of rates of body growth is the first step in many aquatic population studies and fisheries stock assessments. ELEFAN (Electronic LEngth Frequency ANalysis) is a widely used method to fit a growth curve to length-frequency distribution (LFD) data. However, up to now, it was not possible to assess its accuracy or the uncertainty inherent of this method, or to obtain confidence intervals for growth parameters within an unconstrained search space. In this study, experiments were conducted to assess the precision and accuracy of bootstrapped and single-fit ELEFAN-based curve fitting methods, using synthetic LFDs with known input parameters and a real data set of Abra alba shell lengths. The comparison of several types of bootstrap experiments and their outputs (95\% confidence intervals and confidence contour plots) provided a first glimpse into the accuracy of modern ELEFAN-based fit methods. The main components of uncertainty (precision and reproducibility of fit algorithms, seed effects, sample size and matrix information content) could be assessed from partial bootstraps. Uncertainty was mainly determined by LFD matrix size (months x size bins), total number of non-zero bins and the sampling of large-sized individuals. A new pseudo-R² index for the goodness-of-fit of von Bertalanffy growth models to LFD data is proposed. For a large, perfect synthetic data set, pseudo-R²Phi’ was very high (88 to 100\%), indicating an excellent fit of the growth model. The small Abra alba data set showed a low pseudo-R²Phi’, from to 54\% to 68\%, indicating the need for more samples (length measurements) and a larger LFD data matrix. New, robust, bootstrap-based methods for curve fitting are presented and discussed. This study demonstrates a promising new path for length-based analyses of growth and mortality in natural populations, which are the basis for a suite of methods that are included in the new fishboot package.},

            Analysis of length frequency distributions from surveys is one well-known method for obtaining growth parameter estimates where direct age estimates are not available. We present a likelihood-based procedure that uses mixture models and the expectation–maximization algorithm to estimate growth parameters from length frequency data (LFEM). A basic LFEM model estimates a single set of growth parameters that produce one set of component means and standard deviations that best fits length frequency distributions over all years and surveys. The hierarchical extension incorporates bivariate random effects into the model. A hierarchical framework enables inter-annual or inter-cohort variation in some of the growth parameters to be modelled, thereby accommodating some of the natural variation that occurs in fish growth. Testing on two fish species, haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and white-bellied anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius), we were able to obtain reasonable estimates of growth parameters, as well as successfully model growth variability. Estimated growth parameters showed some sensitivity to the starting values and occasionally failed to converge on biologically realistic values. This was dealt with through model selection and was partly addressed by the addition of the hierarchical extension.},

            Performance evaluation of data-limited, length-based methods is instrumental in determining and quantifying their accuracy under various scenarios and in providing guidance about model applicability and limitations. We conducted a simulation–estimation analysis to compare the performance of four length-based stock assessment methods: length-based Thompson and Bell (TB), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME), and length-based risk analysis (LBRA), under varying life history, exploitation status, and recruitment error scenarios. Across all scenarios, TB and LBSPR were the most consistent and accurate assessment methods. LBRA is highly biased, but precautionary, and LIME is more suitable for assessments with time-series longer than a year. All methods have difficulties when assessing short-lived species. The methods are less accurate in estimating the degree of recruitment overfishing when the stocks are severely overexploited, and inconsistent in determining growth overfishing when the stocks are underexploited. Increased recruitment error reduces precision but can decrease bias in estimations. This study highlights the importance of quantifying the accuracy of stock assessment methods and testing methods under different scenarios to determine their strengths and weaknesses and provides guidance on which methods to employ in various situations.},

	abstract = {Electronic LEngth Frequency ANalysis (ELEFAN) is a widely used method to ﬁt von-Bertalanﬀy Growth Function (VBGF) using length frequency data for data-poor ﬁsheries. However accuracy of this method depends on diverse assumptions, among which the variability of individual growth may be particularly inﬂuential. In addition, the selection of class interval of length frequency data, deﬁned as bin size, is also considerable source of uncertainty. However, rare guidance exists on how to account for the growth variability and to select bin size. In this study, we considered the eﬀects of growth variability and bin size together by testing whether appropriate bin size can reduce estimating bias due to growth variability. We used a Monte Carlo simulation framework to evaluate the performances of ELEFAN under scenarios of diﬀerent bin size and levels of individual growth variability for 10 ﬁsh species. The results indicated that growth variability might result in large variations and biased estimation of growth parameters if the bin size was chosen arbitrarily. On the contrary, there was an optimal bin size for each species, which led to unbiased estimates even in a substantially high level of growth variability. Summarizing the optimal bin sizes of the 10 species, we proposed a rule of thumb to select optimal bin size (OBS) for the future applications of ELEFAN according to the maximum body length (OBS= 0.23 × Lmax0.6) and age (OBS= 1.86 × (Lmax/A)0.45) of ﬁsh species. The improvement of accuracy of VBGF parameter estimation will help to understand the growth characteristics and reduce the uncertainty for data-limited stock assessment methods.},

	abstract = {Length-based methods of stock assessment to support scientific fisheries management are desirable in datalimited fisheries where formal stock assessments are commonly constrained. Based on length-frequency (LFQ) data, Electronic length frequency analysis (ELEFAN) is widely used to fit growth curves, but the performance of this method is sensitive to various factors especially the quality of data. Fishing pressure is one of the main drivers that modify the length composition of fish stocks, but the consequent effects on ELEFAN are not well understood. This study aims to clarify the role of fishing pressure on the performance of ELEFAN given fish species with different life history traits. We designed a simulation-estimation framework to simulate the popu­ lation dynamics of short-, medium-, and long-lived fish species, and to evaluate the performance of ELEFAN under varying fishing scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that ELEFAN is robust to changes in sizestructure due to fishing, while its accuracy and precision of outputs depends on the intensity of fishing pres­ sure and the life-history characteristics. The estimates of the parameters of the von-Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) are reliable in short- and medium-lived species, while for long-lived species, fishing may substantially bias the estimates depending on the intensity of fishing pressure. ELEFAN may yield {\textgreater}70\% bias in the estimates of K along with large confidence intervals for long-lived species subject to heavy fishing intensity. ELEFAN will perform such better with prior knowledge about quantities such as lifespan. This study may contribute to the understanding of the reliability of ELEFAN for exploited fisheries and to increasing confidence for adopting ELEFAN in data-limited fisheries.},
