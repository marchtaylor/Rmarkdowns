	abstract = {Ocean biogeochemical provinces have historically been used to characterize regions of similar biogeography, allowing for large-scale comparisons and the definition of possible management units. Recent studies have shown that ocean color (OC) may be used as a proxy for a range of physical and biological parameters, allowing for a more direct approach in defining and monitoring provinces. The current work investigates whether OC-derived provinces (area of a given OC type) can be identified in the North Sea and if they can provide insight into the system's dynamics. The analysis workflow was organized into three main steps: 1. OC type classification based on clustering of normalized reflectance spectra, 2. OC type characterization following match-ups to other biological and physical covariates, and 3. Exploration of drivers of OC province dynamics. Based on data from 1997–2019, four main OC types were identified, which are shown to be related to bio-optical, physical, and zooplankton community covariates. Atlantic-associated OC types varied in their coverage of the North Sea on seasonal and interannual scales, with increased penetration related to periods of a weakened circulation. Interannual variability of OC province extent was also found to correlate with an index of the Subpolar Gyre. These results indicate that the dynamics of OC provinces in the North Sea are likely driven by the interaction between large-scale circulation and local wind-driven and baroclinic currents. The perspective offered by OC provinces helps elucidate spatiotemporal patterns of plankton and is proposed as a novel operational index for additional exploration of ecosystem functioning.},

            Performance evaluation of data-limited, length-based methods is instrumental in determining and quantifying their accuracy under various scenarios and in providing guidance about model applicability and limitations. We conducted a simulation–estimation analysis to compare the performance of four length-based stock assessment methods: length-based Thompson and Bell (TB), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME), and length-based risk analysis (LBRA), under varying life history, exploitation status, and recruitment error scenarios. Across all scenarios, TB and LBSPR were the most consistent and accurate assessment methods. LBRA is highly biased, but precautionary, and LIME is more suitable for assessments with time-series longer than a year. All methods have difficulties when assessing short-lived species. The methods are less accurate in estimating the degree of recruitment overfishing when the stocks are severely overexploited, and inconsistent in determining growth overfishing when the stocks are underexploited. Increased recruitment error reduces precision but can decrease bias in estimations. This study highlights the importance of quantifying the accuracy of stock assessment methods and testing methods under different scenarios to determine their strengths and weaknesses and provides guidance on which methods to employ in various situations.},

	abstract = {Large marine ecosystems (LMEs) are highly productive regions of the world ocean under anthropogenic pressures; we analyzed trends in sea surface temperature (SST), cloud fraction (CF), and chlorophyll concentration (CHL) over the period 1998–2019. Trends in these parameters within LMEs diverged from the world ocean. SST and CF inside LMEs increased at greater rates inside LMEs, whereas CHL decreased at a greater rates. CHL declined in 86\% of all LMEs and of those trends, 70\% were statistically signiﬁcant. Complementary analyses suggest phytoplankton functional types within LMEs have also diverged from those characteristic of the world ocean, most notably, the contribution of diatoms and dinoﬂagellates, which have declined within LMEs. LMEs appear to be warming rapidly and receiving less solar radiation than the world ocean, which may be contributing to changes at the base of the food chain. Despite increased ﬁshing effort, ﬁshery yields in LMEs have not increased, pointing to limitations related to productivity. These changes raise concerns over the stability of these ecosystems and their continued ability to support services to human populations.},
