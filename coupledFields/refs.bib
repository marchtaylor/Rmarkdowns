The physical mechanisms responsible for the first two signals are currently unknown. One of the large-scale, coherent features seems largely independent of the ENSO phenomena, while the second is at least partially related to ENSO and may be part of a recently discovered global mode of SLP variation. Both features resemble various combinations of known teleconnection patterns. These large-scale coherent structures are essentially stationary patterns of SLP variation that grow in place over two to three months. The structures decay more rapidly, typically in 1 month, leading to a highly asymmetric temporal life cycle.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The average forecast skills found in this study are generally low, except in January and February, and are always much lower than expected from studies of potential predictability. Increase in the average skills will require new information uncorrelated with any of the data used in this study and/or prediction schemes that are highly nonlinear. However, the concept of an average skill may be misleading. A forecast quality index is developed and it is shown that one can say in advance that some years will be highly predictable and others not. Use of the classical definition of “winter” in forecast work may not be advisable since each of the months that make up winter are largely uncorrelated and predicted by different atmospheric features.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Four specific methods are compared: principal component analysis with the fields combined (CPCA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and a variant of CCA proposed by Barnett and Preisendorfer (BP), principal component analysis of one single field followed by correlation of its component amplitudes with the second field (SFPCA), and singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix between the two fields (SVD). SVD and CPCA are easier to implement than BP, and do not involve user-chosen parameters. All methods are applied to a simple but geophysically relevant model system and their ability to detect a coupled signal is compared as parameters such as the number of points in each field, the number of samples in the time domain, and the signal-to-noise ratio are varied.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In datasets involving geophysical fields, the number of sampling times may not be much larger than the number of observing locations or grid points for each field. In a model system with these characteristics, CPCA usually extracted the coupled pattern somewhat more accurately than SVD, BP, and SFPCA, since the patterns it yielded exhibit smaller sampling variability; SVD and BP gave quite similar results; and CCA was uncompetitive due to a high sampling variability unless the coupled signal was highly localized. The coupled modes derived from CPCA and SFPCA exhibit an undesirable mean bias toward the leading EOFs of the individual fields; in fact, for small signal-to-noise ratios these methods may identify a coupled signal that is similar to a dominant EOF of one of the fields but is completely orthogonal to the true coupled signal within that field. For longer time series, or in situations where the coupled signal does not resemble the EOFs of the individual fields, these biases can make SVD and BP substantially superior to CPCA.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A statistical model is developed to reconstruct atmospheric surface data for the period 1902–1998 to force a coupled sea ice-ocean model of the Baltic Sea. As the response timescale of the Baltic Sea on freshwater inflow is of the order of 30–40 years, climate relevant model studies should cover at least century-long simulations. Such an observational atmospheric data set is not available yet. We devised a statistical model using a “redundancy analysis” to reconstruct daily sea level pressure (SLP) and monthly surface air temperature (SAT), dew-point temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover of the Baltic. The predictor fields are daily SLP at 19 stations and monthly coarse gridded SAT and precipitation available for the period 1902 to 1998. The second input is a gridded atmospheric data set, with high resolution in space and time, based on synoptic stations, which is available for the period 1970–2001. Spatial patterns are selected by maximizing predictand variance during the “learning” period 1980–1998. The remainder period 1970–1979 is used for validation. We found the highest skill of the statistical model for SLP and the lowest skill for cloud cover. For wintertime the dominant modes of variability on the interannual to interdecadal timescales of the reconstruction are discussed. It is shown that the wintertime variability of SLP, SAT, and precipitation is related to well-known atmospheric patterns of the Northern Hemisphere: the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Scandinavia pattern, the East Atlantic/West Russia pattern, and the Barents Sea Oscillation.},
